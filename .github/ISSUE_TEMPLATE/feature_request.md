## Problem

What problem are you trying to solve?

## Proposed solution

What do you want osu!dash to do?

## Alternatives considered

What other options did you consider?

## Scope

- UI change?
- Server/API change?
- Data model change (`data/*.json`)?

## Security / privacy

Does this touch secrets, filesystem access, replay parsing, or network calls? If yes, explain how you’ll keep it safe (ideally opt-in).
